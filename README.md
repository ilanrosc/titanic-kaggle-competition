# Titanic Kaggle Competition

## Overview
This project is part of the **Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** Kaggle competition. The goal is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using machine learning techniques. We aim to go beyond standard analyses by incorporating advanced feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model optimization techniques to create a unique and competitive solution.

## Steps in the Project
1. **Data Narrative**: Understanding dataset structure and metadata.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns, missing data, and distributions.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful features to improve model performance.
4. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling.
5. **Model Training**: Evaluating different ML models and tuning hyperparameters.
6. **Model Stacking & Tuning**: Optimizing and blending models for better performance.
7. **Final Submission**: Generating predictions for Kaggle submission.

## Installation
To set up the environment, install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Jupyter Notebook
Start Jupyter Notebook using the command:

```sh
jupyter notebook
```

Open the `notebooks/` folder and run the analysis step-by-step.
